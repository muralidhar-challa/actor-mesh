# Actor Mesh — Design Document

## Overview

A minimal distributed actor mesh built on Unix primitives.
No frameworks. No sidecars. No brokers. Just processes.

The runtime is ~506 lines of C. The proxy is ~57 lines of C.
A handler is any process that speaks stdio.

---

## Core Principle

Everything in the mesh is an Actor. The only difference between actor types
is what they subscribe to and what handler they run.

```
SQL Tool    →  actor + handlers/sqlite-tool   subscribes to: sql_query
LLM Agent   →  actor + handlers/llm-agent     subscribes to: user_message, sql_result
Observer    →  actor + <any handler>           subscribes to: heartbeat
```

One binary. Config and handler define behaviour.

---

## Architecture

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                  NNG Proxy                       │
│   sub0 ← collects published messages             │
│   pub0 → fans out to subscribers                 │
│   nng_device(sub, pub) — dumb forwarding         │
└───────────────────┬──────────────────────────────┘
                    │  tcp://
          ┌─────────┼─────────┐
          ↓         ↓         ↓
       Actor A   Actor B   Actor C
       (any)     (any)     (any)
```

Each actor:
- Connects to proxy via NNG pub0 (publish) and sub0 (subscribe)
- Forks a handler process per tuple
- Writes payload to handler stdin
- Reads result from handler stdout
- Publishes result back to bus
- Maintains local LMDB for durability

---

## Tuple Header

Fixed 256-byte binary header. No serialisation library. Cast and read — zero copy.
The header is followed directly by payload bytes in a single contiguous buffer.

```c
typedef struct __attribute__((packed)) {
    char     topic[32];           // NNG subscription prefix (at offset 0)
    uint8_t  id[16];              // uuidv7 binary
    uint8_t  correlation_id[16];  // trace chain end to end
    uint8_t  causation_id[16];    // direct parent tuple id
    char     origin[32];          // actor id who emitted
    int64_t  emitted_at;          // unix nanoseconds
    int64_t  ttl;                 // nanoseconds, 0 = no expiry
    int32_t  attempt;             // retry count, 0 = first
    uint32_t payload_len;         // bytes following this header
    uint8_t  _reserved[120];      // pad to 256 bytes
} actor_header_t;
```

Wire format:
```
[ actor_header_t 256 bytes ][ payload bytes ]
```

Payload is opaque bytes. The runtime never inspects it.

---

## Handler Contract

Handler is any process. The only contract:

```
read payload bytes from stdin
do work
write result bytes to stdout
exit
```

Runtime forks one handler per tuple. Fresh process every time.
No persistent state in handler. No memory leaks. No OOM.

Result topic routing: if stdout starts with a line of the form `topic_name\n`,
the runtime strips it and uses that as the publish topic, overriding
`ACTOR_RESULT_TOPIC`. This lets a single handler emit different tuple types.

```
sql_query\n{"type":"sql_query","sql":"SELECT ..."}
```

Header env vars available to every handler:

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `ACTOR_TUPLE_ID` | hex id of incoming tuple |
| `ACTOR_CORRELATION_ID` | hex correlation id (same across chain) |
| `ACTOR_CAUSATION_ID` | hex id of direct parent tuple |
| `ACTOR_TUPLE_ORIGIN` | origin actor id |
| `ACTOR_ATTEMPT` | retry count |

---

## Multi-topic Subscription

`ACTOR_TOPIC` accepts a comma-separated list:

```sh
ACTOR_TOPIC=user_message,sql_result ./actor
```

One actor instance receives tuples on all listed topics.

---

## Handler Examples

**Shell (zero deps):**
```sh
#!/bin/sh
payload=$(cat)
# Example with any OpenAI-compatible API:
curl -s https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  -d "$(echo "$payload" | jq -c '{model:"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001",max_tokens:1000,messages:[{role:"user",content:.query}]}')" \
  | jq -c '{answer:.content[0].text}'
```

**C binary (zero alloc):**
```c
static char g_in[256*1024];
int main(void) {
    size_t n = fread(g_in, 1, sizeof(g_in)-1, stdin);
    g_in[n] = '\0';
    // ... process ...
    fputs(result, stdout);
}
```

---

## Runtime Lifecycle

```
1. Read config from environment
2. Apply isolation if configured — before sockets, LMDB, or any thread
3. Connect NNG pub0 + sub0 to proxy
4. Open LMDB
5. Enter poll loop:
   a. Emit heartbeat every ACTOR_HEARTBEAT_MS
   b. NNG recvmsg (100ms timeout)
   c. Receive header + payload as single buffer
   d. Cast to actor_header_t (zero copy)
   e. Check TTL — drop if expired
   f. Write frame to LMDB inbox (durability)
   g. Set header env vars, fork handler (+ per-tuple namespaces if configured)
   h. Write payload to handler stdin
   i. Read result into static buffer (capped at ACTOR_MAX_PAYLOAD)
   j. Build result header (carry correlation chain)
   k. Write result frame to LMDB outbox
   l. Publish result to NNG bus
   m. Clear LMDB inbox + outbox
6. On SIGTERM — drain and exit
```

---

## Durability

LMDB per actor pod. Three named databases:

```
inbox/   {uuidv7} → raw frame    written before fork, cleared after publish
outbox/  {uuidv7} → raw frame    written before publish, cleared after publish
state/   {key}    → bytes        handler-managed state (e.g. conversation history)
```

On restart — pending inbox tuples are reprocessed.
Pending outbox tuples are republished.
No central coordinator needed.

Handlers can use the same LMDB (via `ACTOR_LMDB_PATH`) to persist state
keyed by `ACTOR_CORRELATION_ID`, enabling multi-turn conversations across
separate invocations.

---

## Memory Model

Zero heap allocation per tuple in the runtime.

```c
static uint8_t g_result_buf[ACTOR_MAX_PAYLOAD];
static uint8_t g_frame_buf[ACTOR_MAX_PAYLOAD + sizeof(actor_header_t)];
```

Memory footprint is fixed and known at compile time.
Payloads exceeding cap are dropped with a log message — never malloc.

Override at build time:
```bash
make ACTOR_MAX_PAYLOAD=4194304
```

Handlers follow the same discipline: static buffers only, no malloc/realloc.
Data flows as pointers from stdin buffer to stdout — no heap involvement.

---

## Isolation

Optional, opt-in, Linux only. An actor with none of these set behaves exactly
as it did before they existed — that property is asserted by the test suite,
not assumed.

Two scopes, because isolation here has two lifetimes:

**Actor-lifetime** — applied once at startup, before the poll loop and before
any thread is created. Privilege drop, resource limits, cgroup membership,
Landlock, seccomp. These define what this actor may ever do.

**Tuple-lifetime** — applied per message, in the forked child, before `exec`.
Namespaces, created and destroyed with one tuple.

```
1. Read config from environment
2. Isolation: uid/gid, rlimits, cgroup, Landlock, seccomp   ← actor scope
3. Connect NNG, open LMDB, start workers
4. Poll loop:
     fork → unshare namespaces → exec handler               ← tuple scope
```

### Why namespaces are per tuple

A tuple is a self-contained unit of work. The runtime already holds that for
memory (fixed buffers, no heap per tuple) and for process identity (a fresh
fork per handler). The process *tree* was where it leaked: a handler's own
children could outlive it, get reparented to the actor, and accumulate across
tuples meant to be independent.

A namespace created per tuple closes that. When the handler exits, the kernel
kills whatever remains inside it — teardown is not something anyone has to
remember. The tuple leaves no trace, which is what the model claimed in the
first place.

`unshare(CLONE_NEWPID)` does not move the caller into the new namespace; it
makes the caller's *next* fork PID 1 of it, and the namespace dies when that
PID 1 exits. So the runtime forks again after unsharing, and the grandchild —
which is PID 1 — becomes the handler. Placed at startup instead, the first
handler would be PID 1 and every later tuple would fork into a dead namespace.

### Fail closed

A variable that is set and cannot be honoured aborts startup. An actor that
runs less confined than it believes it is, is worse than one that never tried:
the deployment sees no error and assumes a boundary it does not have. A
malformed value is an error too — reading `ACTOR_UID=root` as uid 0 is the
worst available reading of a typo.

### Practical notes

- **`ACTOR_LMDB_PATH` must be inside `ACTOR_LANDLOCK_RW`.** The actor opens its
  database after the ruleset is enforced. This is checked at startup so the
  message names the real problem.
- **`ACTOR_LANDLOCK_RO` must cover the whole exec path**: `/bin/sh`, the handler,
  the dynamic loader and every library they need. On glibc that is `/usr` and
  `/lib64`; on musl `/usr` and `/lib`. A missing entry produces a handler that
  cannot start.
- **`ACTOR_RLIMIT_NPROC` counts every process and thread for the real uid,
  system-wide** — not the actor's descendants. Give an actor its own uid and
  size the limit against `ps -L -u <uid> | wc -l`, or a value that looks
  generous can already be below current usage and the actor dies on its first
  `pthread_create`.
- **Namespaces need privilege.** Unprivileged `unshare(CLONE_NEWPID)` is EPERM
  on a stock host; the runtime retries behind a user namespace, which works
  where unprivileged user namespaces are enabled. `ACTOR_TUPLE_USERNS=0` opts
  out.
- **`ACTOR_SECCOMP=1` and `ACTOR_TUPLE_UNSHARE` conflict** and are refused
  together: the filter is inherited by the child, where the namespaces need
  `unshare` and the mount family. Use `ACTOR_SECCOMP=permissive_mount`.

### Observing what handlers actually call

The seccomp denylist is a fixed set of calls no handler should need. It is not
derived from your handlers, and it cannot be: the handler contract is "any
process that speaks stdio", so the syscall set moves with the language, the
libc, and the work. The list shipped here was validated by tracing the runtime
plus shell handlers — 57 distinct calls — which is enough to justify a denylist
and nowhere near enough to justify an allowlist.

eBPF is the right tool for closing that gap. It belongs to the *node*, not to
the actor: a privileged agent shipped in the node image, observing the
unprivileged workloads around it. That is the usual shape and it keeps the
privilege boundary intact — the actor still cannot see or influence the tracer,
and the seccomp filter denies `bpf` so it cannot start one of its own. Same rule
as cgroups: the runtime is observed and joins what it is given; it does not
provision.

If you build the node image, this is close to free. `ACTOR_CGROUP_PATH` already
gives every actor a cgroup identity the kernel can filter on, so a single
node-level agent attributes syscalls per actor with no change to the runtime and
no per-actor configuration.

What it buys:

- **Keeping the denylist honest.** If a handler starts calling something the
  list denies, you see it before it becomes a failed tuple in production.
- **Narrowing toward an allowlist where it is safe.** For a *known, fixed* set
  of handlers — one org's tools, say — the observed set over weeks is real
  evidence, and an allowlist built from it is defensible in a way one built from
  a hand-trace is not.
- **Attributing a denial.** A tuple that failed under seccomp says only that the
  handler exited non-zero. A trace says which syscall, in which handler, for
  which correlation id.

Off-the-shelf tooling is enough; nothing custom is required:

```sh
# What is every handler under this actor calling?
sudo execsnoop-bpfcc                       # exec of each handler
sudo syscount-bpfcc -p $(pgrep -f bin/actor) -L    # per-syscall counts

# Or scope by cgroup, if actors join one (ACTOR_CGROUP_PATH)
sudo bpftrace -e 'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter
                  /cgroup == cgroupid("/sys/fs/cgroup/actors/org-a")/
                  { @[args.id] = count(); }'
```

The cgroup form is the useful one at scale: `ACTOR_CGROUP_PATH` already gives
each actor a stable identity the kernel understands, so a trace can be scoped to
one actor, one org, or the whole fleet without touching the runtime.

This is deliberately not built into the runtime. Adding it would mean the actor
loading kernel programs — the privilege the rest of this design spends its
effort giving up, and the one thing a compromised handler would most want. As a
separate privileged component on a node image you control, it is exactly the
right place for it.

### Example

```sh
ACTOR_ID=sqlite-tool-1 \
ACTOR_TOPIC=sql_query ACTOR_RESULT_TOPIC=sql_result \
ACTOR_HANDLER=/handlers/sqlite-tool \
ACTOR_LMDB_PATH=/var/actor/db \
ACTOR_UID=61000 ACTOR_GID=61000 \
ACTOR_RLIMIT_AS=536870912 ACTOR_RLIMIT_NOFILE=256 \
ACTOR_LANDLOCK_RO=/usr:/lib64 \
ACTOR_LANDLOCK_RW=/var/actor/db \
ACTOR_TUPLE_UNSHARE=pid,ipc,uts \
ACTOR_SECCOMP=permissive_mount \
./actor &
```

---

## Heartbeat

Every actor emits a heartbeat tuple periodically:

```json
{"id": "sqlite-tool-1", "inbox": 0, "outbox": 0}
```

Topic: `heartbeat`
TTL: 3 × heartbeat interval

Any actor subscribed to `heartbeat` can observe the mesh state.

---

## Retry Policy

On handler failure (non-zero exit):
```
attempt 1  →  retry after 100ms
attempt 2  →  retry after 200ms
attempt 3  →  retry after 400ms
max retry  →  drop tuple, log error
```

Controlled by `ACTOR_RETRY_MAX` (default 3).
Payload cap exceeded → drop immediately, no retry.

## Lineage

This design independently converges on:

- **Erlang/OTP (1986)** — actor model, let it crash, message passing
- **Unix pipes (1969)** — stdio as universal process interface
- **Linda tuplespace (1986)** — decoupled coordination via shared space
- **Plan 9** — everything is a file, communicate via read/write

The difference: C native, zero framework, same binary edge to cloud.
