/* ── Per-tuple namespaces ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Applied in the forked child, before exec, so the namespaces live and die
 * with one tuple.
 *
 * Why per tuple rather than once at startup. A tuple is a self-contained unit
 * of work -- that is the tuple space's premise, and the runtime already holds
 * it for memory (fixed buffers, no heap per tuple) and for process identity (a
 * fresh fork per handler). The process TREE was the place it leaked: a
 * handler's own children could outlive it, get reparented to the actor, and
 * accumulate across tuples that were supposed to be independent. A namespace
 * created here closes that: when the handler exits, the kernel kills whatever
 * remains inside it. The tuple leaves no trace, which is what the model
 * claimed in the first place.
 *
 * The PID namespace needs care, and is the reason this function forks.
 * unshare(CLONE_NEWPID) does NOT move the caller into the new namespace: it
 * arranges for the caller's NEXT fork to produce a child that is PID 1 of it,
 * and the namespace is destroyed when that PID 1 exits. So unsharing and then
 * exec'ing in the same process leaves the handler outside the namespace it
 * just made -- the namespace exists, is empty, and confines nothing.
 *
 * Hence the second fork below. The caller unshares, forks, and the grandchild
 * -- which IS pid 1 of the new namespace -- becomes the handler. The
 * intermediate process waits and relays the exit status, so the runtime's
 * existing view of "the child I forked exited with status N" is unchanged and
 * the reaper, retry and rejection paths need no adjustment.
 *
 * Placing this per tuple rather than at startup matters for the same reason:
 * called once at startup the first handler would be pid 1, the namespace would
 * die with it, and every later tuple would fork into a dead namespace.
 *
 * Cost is tens of microseconds against a fork/exec measured in the hundreds of
 * milliseconds for a statically linked handler. Not measurable. The mount
 * namespace with pivot_root is the exception and is not part of this phase.
 *
 * Returns 0 on success. On failure the caller _exits non-zero, which the
 * existing retry path already treats as a failed handler run -- no new error
 * channel, and a tuple never runs less isolated than configured.

/* ── Landlock ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Path-based confinement: after landlock_restrict_self the process may only
 * touch what was explicitly granted. Everything else fails as though it were
 * not there.
 *
 * Two things about the read set are easy to get wrong and expensive to debug,
 * so they are stated here rather than left to the operator:
 *
 *   - ACTOR_LMDB_PATH must be inside ACTOR_LANDLOCK_RW. The actor opens its
 *     LMDB after this runs, so a path outside the ruleset turns into an
 *     LMDB error at startup rather than an obvious configuration one. This
 *     module checks for it explicitly and says so.
 *
 *   - The exec path needs more than the handler binary. The runtime runs
 *     handlers via execl("/bin/sh", "sh", "-c", ...), so /bin/sh, the handler
 *     itself, the dynamic loader and every shared library they pull in must be
 *     readable and executable. On a distro build of this runtime that is
 *     /lib64 and /usr/lib64 (libnng, liblmdb, libc, libtinfo, the mbedtls
 *     trio, ld-linux). A statically linked handler needs far less.
 *
 * There is no ambient "allow everything not mentioned": a ruleset with no
 * rules denies everything. So an ACTOR_LANDLOCK_RO that forgets the loader
 * produces a handler that cannot start, which is why phase 2 does not ship
 * without the enumeration above having been done for a real handler.
